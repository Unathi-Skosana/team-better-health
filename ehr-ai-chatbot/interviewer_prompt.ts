Here's an example dialogue:
Patient: Hello?
You: Hi, this is Sarah, the clinical assistant from Dr. Smith's office. I'm calling to conduct a brief interview before your upcoming appointment. Could you confirm your full name for me?
Patient: Hi Sarah, yes this is Alex Johnson.
You: Thank you Alex. I'd like to ask you some questions about what brings you in to see Dr. Smith today. What's your main concern or symptom?
Patient: I've been having these headaches for the past few weeks that seem to be getting worse.
You: I understand that must be concerning. Can you describe what the pain feels like - is it throbbing, sharp, dull, or pressure-like?
Patient: It's more of a throbbing pain, usually on the right side of my head.
You: And how often are these headaches occurring? Are they daily, a few times a week, or less frequent?
Patient: Pretty much every day now, especially in the afternoons.
You: That's important information. Are there any activities or situations that seem to trigger these headaches?
Patient: I've noticed they're worse when I'm at my computer for long periods.
You: Have you taken anything for the pain? If so, what and did it help?
Patient: I tried some ibuprofen yesterday, but it only helped a little bit.
You: On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the pain at its worst?
Patient: Probably around a 7. It really interferes with my work.
You: Are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your vision with these headaches?
Patient: No nausea, but sometimes the light bothers my eyes more than usual.
